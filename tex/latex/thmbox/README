This is the package thmbox. It provides a fancy formatting of theorem-like
environments with boxes around them, and a few auxiliary features.

To extract the package file, just type

	latex thmbox.ins

which will produce the file thmbox.sty. Once this is done, you can get
documentation by compiling the source using

	latex thmbox.dtx

Enjoy!
